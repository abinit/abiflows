AbiFlows is a framework for Python >= 3.6 that provides workflows to automate ab-initio calculations
with Abinit based on the `Fireworks <https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/>`_ framework.
The package is relies on external libraries, mainly `Abipy <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/>`_ and
`Pymatgen <http://www.pymatgen.org>`_, to handle the input generation and parse the output files.
The package also offers a set of tools to store the outputs generated by the workflows in
MongoDB documents and to easily retrieve them.

Abiflows is meant mainly for running Abinit calculations in a high-throughput regime, when it
is important to rely on a database both for handling the calculations and to store the results.
While it provides a wide support for different types of  calculations, this necessarily comes at
the price of some limitations on the configurations that one can set for Abinit. If you are
interested in running just a small set of calculations, we suggest to consider using the
`Abipy workflows <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/flow_gallery/index.html>`_ instead.

AbiFlows is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this library by making your own contributions.
Please report any bugs and issues at AbiFlows `Github page <https://github.com/abinit/abiflows>`_.
